When the sum of the wasted space in all bins surpasses a certain threshold (in this case, the minimum weight of the remaining objects), the reorganization is triggered. During reorganization, the algorithm examines each bin, and if the last item in a bin has lost space (remaining space below the minimum weight) that is considered non-optimal, the algorithm removes this item. Subsequently, it identifies an item from the remaining pool of objects that maximizes the lost space and places it into the bin. This iterative process is designed to improve the space utilization of the bins and, potentially, reduce the overall number of bins used, as it alternates between the Best Fit algorithm and a worst-case placement strategy for lost space maximization."],"metadata":{"id":"eBBa_idznMZ_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def reorganize_bins(bins, weights):\n","    # Calculate the minimum weight of the remaining objects\n","    min_remaining_weight = min(weights)\n","\n","    # Calculate the sum of wasted space in all bins\n","    wasted_space_sum = sum([bin_space_left for bin_space_left in bins if bin_space_left < min_remaining_weight])\n","    #print(f\" min= {min_remaining_weight} | waste= , {wasted_space_sum}\")\n","\n","    # Check if reorganization is needed\n","    if wasted_space_sum >= min_remaining_weight:\n","        removed_items = []  # To store the removed items\n","\n","        # Sort bins by remaining space in descending order\n","        sorted_bins = sorted(enumerate(bins), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n","\n","        # Iterate through the bins and try to reorganize\n","        for i, bin_space_left in sorted_bins:\n","            if bin_space_left >= min_remaining_weight:\n","                # Check if the last item in the bin has lost space less than min weight\n","                last_item_lost_space = bin_space_left -
